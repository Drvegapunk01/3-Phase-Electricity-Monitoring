# 3-Phase-Electricity-Monitoring

This project is a module to monitor the status of a 3-phase electricity supply and record any power outages. The data can be accessed wirelessly.
Currently, the features are limited to detecting the power state only.

This project was inspired by my father’s question about whether it’s possible to create a device that records power outages at the TV transmitter station where he works.
